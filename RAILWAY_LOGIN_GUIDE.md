## To Share With Your Players

Send this to your tennis players:

```
The NET WORTH Tennis Ladder is now live!

🌐 View Ladder: https://yourapp.railway.app
📋 Rules: https://yourapp.railway.app/rules.html
💡 Support: https://yourapp.railway.app/support.html

To login and report scores:
- Email: Your email address (as registered)
- Password: tennis123

Contact: matches@networthtennis.com
```

---

## Security Note

**Current setup:** Everyone uses password `tennis123`

This is fine for a closed group of 40 tennis players you know. If you want individual passwords later, let me know and I'll add:
- Password reset via email
- Individual password hashing
- Email verification

For now, this works perfectly for your tennis ladder!

Via the API, players can:
- ✅ View their personal stats
