## Questions?

### Where's the database?
✅ Already in git at `networth_tennis.db` - Railway deploys it automatically

### Where's the frontend?
✅ `production_server.py` serves all HTML files (index.html, privacy.html, etc.)

### Where's the backend?
✅ Same `production_server.py` - it's one unified Flask app

### Do I need Vercel?
❌ NO - everything runs on Railway

### Cost?
**$0** - Railway free tier includes 500 hours/month (way more than you need)

---

## That's It!

No Vercel. No confusion. No future effort.

**Everything runs on Railway.**

Go to https://railway.app and follow the 7 steps above. See you in 20 minutes! 🎾
