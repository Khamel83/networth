## 🌟 Custom Domain Setup

Once you buy a domain:

## 💡 Smart Features

- **Community building**: Focus on actual tennis, not app engagement

## 🎾 This Isn't A Product

- Ashley Kaufman wants people playing tennis
- Players want partners, not another app
- LA has tennis courts, not enough connections

**We eliminate all the friction:**
- ❌ "I have to browse profiles"
- ❌ "We message back and forth"
- ❌ "We can never find a time"
- ✅ "You're matched, here's their contact, play tennis"
