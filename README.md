# ONE_SHOT: AI-Powered Autonomous Project Builder

**Version**: 1.2
**Status**: Framework Complete - Ready for Project Execution
**Philosophy**: Ask everything upfront, then execute autonomously

---

## What This Is

ONE_SHOT is a complete project-building methodology that transforms a 20-question questionnaire into a fully deployed application. It's not a project itself - it's a system for building projects autonomously using AI.

**Single file**: `one_shot.md` contains the entire workflow
**Target infrastructure**: OCI Always Free + Tailscale + GitHub ($0/month)
**Core principle**: Validate Before Create, Dependency Awareness, WHY documentation

---

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Interactive (5-15 minutes)
1. Answer 20 detailed questions about your project
2. Validate connections (GitHub, Tailscale, dependencies)
3. Make all architectural decisions upfront
4. Generate complete Product Requirements Document

### Phase 2: Autonomous (hours to days)
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Implement all features based on PRD
3. Write tests and documentation
4. Deploy to Tailscale HTTPS
5. Commit and push automatically

### Result
Working project at `https://[project].deer-panga.ts.net` with complete source code on GitHub.

## Current Status

**✅ Complete**:
- ONE_SHOT framework with Archon methodology integration
- 20-question project questionnaire
- Validation scripts and environment checks
- PRD generation templates
- Deployment automation patterns
- Troubleshooting methodology
- Microservices communication patterns
- Health endpoint standards

**🔄 Ready For**:
- First project execution using the framework
- Real-world testing and refinement

## Key Innovations

### Front-Loaded Decision Making
- No "we'll figure it out later"
- All architectural choices made before first line of code
- Prevents scope creep and analysis paralysis

### Archon Integration
- Validate Before Create principle
- Systematic debugging methodology
- Dependency awareness and circular prevention
- WHY documentation, not just HOW

### $0 Infrastructure
- OCI Always Free Tier for compute
- Tailscale for SSL/reverse proxy
- GitHub for code hosting
- No ongoing costs

### Autonomous Execution
- Single command approval triggers complete build
- AI handles all implementation details
- Automatic testing and deployment
- Progress tracking via git commits

---

## Example Projects You Could Build

- **CLI Tool**: Finance tracker that imports CSV transactions
- **Web App**: Personal knowledge manager for newsletters/podcasts
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated social media content scraper
- **API Service**: URL shortener with analytics
- **Background Service**: File watcher with automated processing

Each starts with the same 20-question process, ends with deployed working code.

---

## How to Use

1. **Read `one_shot.md` completely** - It contains the entire methodology
2. **Answer the questionnaire** starting at Q1 and working through Q20
3. **Run environment validation** to ensure all dependencies work
4. **Say "PRD approved. Execute autonomous build"**
5. **Go do other things** while AI builds your project

The framework handles everything else automatically.

## Architecture & Principles

### Validate Before Create
Always check task validity before creation. Environment validation prevents wasted effort.

### Dependency Awareness
Understand and document service dependencies. Prevent circular dependencies.

### Document the WHY
Why this database choice? Why this architecture? HOW changes, WHY remains constant.

### Progressive Enhancement
Build v1 that works. Iterate to v2 when needed. Don't over-engineer upfront.

### Free Infrastructure Default
Design for $0/month by default. Only add costs when absolutely necessary.

## Development History

- **v1.2** (2024-11-21): Complete Archon integration with systematic debugging
- **v1.1** (2024-11-21): Added Archon methodology - Validate Before Create
- **v1.0** (2024-11-21): Initial ONE_SHOT framework based on RelayQ patterns

---

## Next Steps

This framework is **complete and ready for use**. The next step is to:

1. **Build your first project** using the ONE_SHOT questionnaire
2. **Refine based on experience** - what questions were unclear? What could be smarter?
3. **Create project templates** for common project types
4. **Share the methodology** with others who want autonomous project building

**ONE_SHOT turns project ideas into deployed reality through structured questions and autonomous execution.**

*Start in `one_shot.md` at Q1.*
