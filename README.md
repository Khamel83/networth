## 🔧 Ashley Kaufman's Admin Tools

```bash
# Add players
python3 simple_matcher.py --add-player "Name" "email" "phone" "skill" "zip" "times"

# List all players
python3 simple_matcher.py --list-players

# Run matching manually
python3 simple_matcher.py --run-matching

# Export data for backup
python3 simple_matcher.py --export backup.csv
```

## 🌟 Custom Domain Setup

Once you buy a domain:
1. Point DNS to server IP (I'll provide)
2. I'll configure SSL automatically
3. Your tennis matcher lives at `your-domain.com`
4. Professional email: `info@your-domain.com`

## 💡 Smart Features

- **Anti-spam**: Only matched players get contacted
- **Smart matching**: Skill level + location + schedule compatibility
- **No repeats**: Won't match same people within 2 weeks
- **Reliability tracking**: Players who don't show up get matched less
- **Community building**: Focus on actual tennis, not app engagement

## 🎾 This Isn't A Product

**This is a solution to a problem:**
- Ashley Kaufman wants people playing tennis
- Players want partners, not another app
- LA has tennis courts, not enough connections

**We eliminate all the friction:**
- ❌ "I have to browse profiles"
- ❌ "We message back and forth"
- ❌ "We can never find a time"
- ✅ "You're matched, here's their contact, play tennis"
