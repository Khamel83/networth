# PLAYER ONBOARDING - HOW TO EXISTING PLAYERS LOGIN

## Option 1: NO LOGIN (RECOMMENDED - SIMPLEST)

**Ashley sends ONE group email:**
```
Subject: 🎾 Your New Tennis Matching System!

Hi everyone!

I've set up automatic tennis matching for LA.

No login required - you'll just get emails when I find you a perfect match!

**How it works:**
1. You'll get an email: "Matched with John! Skill: 3.5"
2. Click "YES" if you can play
3. Get John's contact info immediately
4. Coordinate and play tennis!

**Starting Monday:** I'll run matching every morning.
Check your email for tennis matches!

Questions? Just reply to this email.

## Option 2: SIMPLE PASSWORD (IF Ashley wants security)

**Ashley sends group email:**
```
Subject: 🎾 Welcome to Your Tennis Matching System!

Welcome! Your account is ready:

**Login URL:** https://networthtennis.club/login
**Email:** your-email@address.com
**Password:** tennis123 (everyone uses this)

Change your password after first login if you want.

You'll get match notifications and can confirm matches online!

Starting Monday: Automatic matching begins!

## OPTION 1 IS BETTER BECAUSE:
- ✅ Zero friction (no passwords to remember)
- ✅ Higher engagement (no login barrier)
- ✅ Email-first (everyone checks email)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (works on any phone)
- ✅ Professional (email domain looks legit)

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION:

**Use Option 1 - Email Only**

Just send the one group email, then let the automatic matching system do everything.

Players love simple - no apps, no passwords, just direct tennis connections! 🎾
